# NaviGAte
Library for humanoid agent navigation using genetic algorithms.

## Introduction
This project is a continuation of previous proof of concept that is presented in [GACollision](https://github.com/lakatop/GACollision) project. Previous project implemented path navigation algorithm using GA inside Unity environment. This project focuses on extracting crucial parts of algorithm into separate C++ library, and iterating on previously learned findings.
